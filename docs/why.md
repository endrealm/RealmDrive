#### Why to use RealmDrive?
Tired of learning different languages for databases. RealmDrive is an open source project that translates you java classes to backend entries. Write and read data with complex queries with the RealmDrive Query System.
#### Want to support different databases, but don't want to implement each driver manually?
RealmDrive is a good solution here. The ServiceFactory allows you to create n-different database connections without having to change your 'java entities'.

#### Soon on your local repositories
Integrated reactive style allows working with non-blocking query calls. Read and write values, execute different code pieces upon different result events. More to reactive program design [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming).
